# emUSB Device: HID generic application

This code example demonstrates the usage of emUSB device middleware stack to configure the USB block in a supportd Infineon MCU as a generic Human Interface Device (HID). It takes help from an external HID software tool to send in the generic HID inputs which it then relays back.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

This example requires an external HID software tool to act as a generic HID host for the emUSB device.

Instructions in this document use this [USB-HID tool](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/USB-HID-Tool) to write and read data to/from a HID device. 
Download the GitHub project available at this [link](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/USB-HID-Tool/archive/master.zip). You should see a /bin folder that contains the usbhidtool executable available for different systems.

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[Hello world](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-hal-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-example-hal-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation


1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>
   <br />

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>
   <br />

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that title of the code example is displayed on the UART terminal.


   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/emusb-hid-device-initialization.png)



5. The user LED will blink at 2 Hz to indicate that the board is ready to be configured and used as an emUSB HID device.

6. Connect the board to your PC from the PSoC 6 USB Device port via a micro USB cable.

7. The user LED will stop blinking to indicate that the emUSB device has been detected successfully. 

8. On the computer, open a terminal console and run the *usbhidtool* to send a few bytes. The tool requires as argument the VID, PID, number of bytes to send, and data. See the [USB-HID tool documentation](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/USB-HID-Tool/blob/master/README.md) or use the following example:

    **In Windows:**
    ```
    usbhidtool.exe 0x058B 0x0274 4 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
    ```

    **In Linux:**
    ```
    ./usbhidtool 0x058B 0x0274 4 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF
    ```
    - After writing to the device, you should see the same data written back to the terminal console.
    ```
    de ad be ef 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    ```
    **Note:** The *usbhidtool* always sends 64 bytes to the device, independent of how many bytes provided. Any remaining data is written with zeros.



## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â€“ once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This code example intends to provide the functionality of a generic Human Interface Device (HID) using the Segger emUSB device middleware library. The USB Implementers Forum has defined the Human Interface Device class (HID) as an abstract USB class protocol which was developed for handling devices that would be used directly by users use to control the operation of computer systems. 

The firmware consists of a `main()` function and two separate application functions `usbd_hid_init()` and `usbd_hid_echo_task()` to implement the desired functionality. The main function is responsible for calling the relevant emUSB device middleware target APIs and application functions respectively for the initialization of the emUSB device stack `USBD_Init()`, and setting up the end point information for HID class. For more information regarding the usage of emUSB device Target APIs, refer to the [emUSB Device User Guide](https://github.com/Infineon/emusb-device/blob/master/docs/UM09001_emUSBD.pdf) (locally available at *<mtb_shared>/emusb-device/<version-tag>/docs*)

A report descriptor is a structure which is used to transmit HID control data to and from a human interface device. A report descriptor defines the format of a report and is composed of report items that define one or more top-level collections. Each collection defines one or more HID reports. Usages are a part of HID report descriptors which is used to indicate the vendor's suggested use for a specific control or a group of controls. The usage of an HID application is defined using a usage page ID. More information regarding HID usage pages can be found at the resource links given below. In this example, we have used the usage table for a generic USB device. Refer to Universal Serial Bus Specification and the HID Usage Tables guide for detailed information about HID input, output and feature reports.

The application function `usbd_hid_init()` utilizes the `usb_hid_generic_report` to capture the generic HID description of the emUSB device and set up the USB device endpoint. The generic USB-HID report in `usb_hid_generic_report` is generated using the following documents and HID descriptor tool given by the [USB Implementers Forum](https://www.usb.org/) (USB-IF) on their website.

 Name | Description
------|------------
[HID Spec Definition](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/hid1_11.pdf) | Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID) Firmware Specification (5/27/2001), Version 1.11
[HID Usage Tables](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_3_0.pdf) | HID Usage Tables for Universal Serial Bus (USB) Version 1.3
[HID Descriptor Tool](https://www.usb.org/document-library/hid-descriptor-tool)| Generic HID Descriptor Tool by USB Implementers Forum 


The firmware then configures the device information for enumeration using the target API `USBD_SetDeviceInfo()`. After the USB core configuration is done, the target API `USBD_Start()` is called which initiates a hardware attach and updates the endpoint configuration. The application function `usbd_hid_echo_task()` is where the USB device waits to be configured. The user LED blinks at 2 Hz to signify the wait state. When the USB cable is connected to the device, the host will start enumeration of the device and the device will function as a generic USB HID device which echoes the generic HID inputs to the terminal using the target APIs `USBD_HID_Read()` and `USBD_HID_Write()` to read and write the HID data respectively.
